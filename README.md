==========

This project fouces on getting various camera modules to work with easy.
Right now it supports the arduino mega and uses the seeedstudio tft v1.0 I may add more screens if I purchase another type
For camera modules it supports the ov7670 and mostly the MT9D111 and ov7740 coming soon.
Some goals for this project are to support more microcontrollers and add support for more camera modules
The reason for doing this is to give people an easy way to get their camera modules up and running.
