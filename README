This project focuses on getting various camera modules to work quickly. Right
now the Arduino Mega 2560 is supported and uses the Seeedstudio TFT v1.0 I may
add more screens if I purchase another type. For camera modules it supports the
OV7670 and mostly the MT9D111 and OV7740 coming soon. Some goals for this
project are to support more microcontrollers and add support for more camera
modules. This program should give people an easy way to get their camera
modules up and running.

Connections:

Miscellaneous
LED->4

For OV7670:
OV7670->Arduino Mega 2560
SIOC->21
SIOD->20
VSYNC->3
PCLK->2
XCLK-> {convert to 3.3v} 46
D0->37
D1->36
D2->35
D3->34
D4->33
D5->32
D6->31
D7->30
PWDN->GND
RESET->3.3v
Power the module with 3.3v only. 5v could cause damage.

Seedstudio TFT v1.0 connections
TFT->Arduino Mega 2560
DO->22
D1->23
D2->24
D4->26
D5->27
D6->28
D7->29
CS->10
RS->11
WR->12
RD->13
The touch pins are sequential
Touch Y->A0
Touch X->A1
Touch Y+>A2
Touch X+>A3
This is powered with 5v. If you use 3.3v the screen will be dark. I am not sure
if 3.3v is within the operating range for all parts on the board.
